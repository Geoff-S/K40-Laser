#Interface Board
This is a cut down vcopy of the kicad project related to the interface
PCB designed by Scott Bragg to handle voltage level problems between the
RPI-CNC and the K40 end stop circuit
The original kicad filea are on gitlab, not git hub (as far as I can tell)

The schematic is as published by Scott with some notes on connections by me
(GeoffS). Any mistakes are mine.

Ignore the PCB file, it's not the one you're looking for. Move along
